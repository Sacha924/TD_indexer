## Part 1 (Smart Contract + React App)

The Chainlink price feed is utilized in this project to provide a reliable and secure source of price data for the tokens involved in the swap process. Chainlink's decentralized oracle network allows us to fetch up-to-date and accurate price information, which is crucial for ensuring fair and consistent token swap transactions.

The accompanying React application is intentionally kept basic with a single file and inline CSS styling to focus on showcasing the core functionality of the smart contract interactions.
